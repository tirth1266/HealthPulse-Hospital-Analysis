# HealthPulse: Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) for a healthcare facility. The analysis was conducted on a sample dataset designed to represent patient and operational data, allowing for in-depth insights into patient care, departmental efficiency, and overall performance.
